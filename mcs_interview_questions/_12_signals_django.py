12. what are the signals in django?


Django includes a “signal dispatcher” which helps decoupled applications get notified when actions
occur elsewhere in the framework. In a nutshell, signals allow certain senders to notify a set of
receivers that some action has taken place.They’re especially useful when many pieces of code may
be interested in the same events.

A list of all the signals that Django sends. All built-in signals are sent using the send() method.
