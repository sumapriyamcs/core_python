16. what is nosql database?


NOSQL is a non-relational DMS, that does not require a fixed schema, avoids joins, and is
easy to scale. NoSQL database is used for distributed data stores with humongous data storage
needs. NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps. For example companies like Twitter,
Facebook, Google that collect terabytes of user data every single day.

NoSQL database stands for “Not Only SQL” or “Not SQL.”
NoSQL databases are purpose built for specific data models and have flexible schemas for
building modern applications. NoSQL databases are widely recognized for their ease of
development, functionality, and performance at scale.

‘NoSQL’ refers to nonrelational types of databases, and these databases store data
in a format that’s different from relational tables. However, NoSQL databases can
be queried using idiomatic language APIs, declarative structured query languages,
and query-by example languages, which is why they are also referred to as “not only SQL” databases.

#examples:
MongoDB, CouchDB, CouchBase, Cassandra, HBase, Redis, Riak, Neo4J are the popular
NoSQL databases examples. MongoDB, CouchDB, CouchBase , Amazon SimpleDB, Riak, Lotus
Notes are Document-oriented NoSQL databases. Tokyo Cabinet/Tyrant, Redis, Riak, Voldemort,
Oracle BDB, Amazon SimpleDB are Key-value stores Databases.

==>Types of NoSQL database:

Types of NoSQL databases and the name of the databases system that falls in that category are:

    MongoDB falls in the category of NoSQL document based database.
    Key value store: Memcached, Redis, Coherence
    Tabular: Hbase, Big Table, Accumulo
    Document based: MongoDB, CouchDB, Cloudant

==>When should NoSQL be used:

    1.When huge amount of data need to be stored and retrieved .
    2.The relationship between the data you store is not that important
    3.The data changing over time and is not structured.
    4.Support of Constraints and Joins is not required at database level
    5.The data is growing continuously and you need to scale the database regular to handle the data

==>advantages of nosql:
    1. high scalability
    2.high availability

==>disadvantages of nosql:
    1.Narrow focus
    2.Open-source
    3.Management challenge
    4.GUI is not available
    5.Backup
    6.Large document size

==>NOSQL:

    1.NoSQL databases are categorized as Non-relational or distributed database system.
    2.NoSQL databases have dynamic schema.
    3.NoSQL databases display data as collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases
    or wide-column stores.
    4.NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
    5.In NoSQL databases, collection of documents are used to query the data. It is also called
    unstructured query language. It varies from database to database.
    6.NoSQL databases are not so good for complex queries because these are not as powerful as SQL queries.
    7.NoSQL databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage.
    8.MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDB, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDB etc. are the
    example of nosql database
