19. architecture of django?

Django is based on MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture. MVT is a software design pattern for
developing a web application. View: The View is the user interface â€” what you see in your browser
when you render a website. It is represented by HTML/CSS/Javascript and Jinja files.

The MVT (Model View Template) is a software design pattern. It is a collection of three important
components Model View and Template. The Model helps to handle database. It is a data access layer
which handles the data.

The Template is a presentation layer which handles User Interface part completely. The View is
used to execute the business logic and interact with a model to carry data and renders a template.

Although Django follows MVC pattern but maintains it?s own conventions. So, control is handled by
the framework itself.

There is no separate controller and complete application is based on Model View and Template.
That?s why it is called MVT application.

#architecture:

USER->DJANGO
        |
        URL->VIEW-->MODEL
                    TEMPLATE

Here, a user requests for a resource to the Django, Django works as a controller and check
to the available resource in URL.

If URL maps, a view is called that interact with model and template, it renders a template.

Django responds back to the user and sends a template as a response.
