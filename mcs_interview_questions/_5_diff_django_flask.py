5. what is the difference between django and flask?

What is Flask?

Flask is an micro framework offering basic features of web app.
This framework has no dependencies on external libraries. The framework offers
extensions for form validation, object-relational mappers, open authentication
systems, uploading mechanism, and several other tools.

What is Django?

Django is a web development framework for Python. This framework offers a standard
method for fast and effective website development. It helps you in building and
maintaining quality web applications. It enables you to make the development process
smooth and time-saving.

It is a high-level web framework which allows performing rapid development.
The primary goal of this web framework is to create complex database-driven websites.


5.1: KEY DIFFERENCES:

1.Flask provides support for API while Django doesn’t have any support for API.
2.Flask does not support dynamic HTML pages and Django offers dynamic HTML pages.
3.Flask is a Python web framework built for rapid development whereas Django is built
for easy and simple projects.

4.Flask offers a diversified working style while Django offers a Monolithic working style.
5.URL dispatcher of the Flask web framework is a RESTful request on the other hand,
URL dispatcher of Django framework is based on controller-regex.

6.Flask is WSGI framework while Django is a Full Stack Web Framework.

5.2:Features of Flask:

Here, are important features of Flask

1.Integrated support for unit testing.
2.RESTful request dispatching.
3.Uses a Ninja2 template engine.
4.It is based on Werkzeug toolkit.
5.Support for secure cookies (client-side sessions).
6.Extensive documentation.
7.Google app engine compatibility.
8.APIs are nicely shaped and coherent
9.Easily deployable in production

5.3:Features of Django:

Here are important features of Django:

1.Offers Model – View – Controller (MVC) Architecture.
2.Predefined libraries for imaging, graphics, scientific calculations, etc.
3.Supports for multiple databases.
4.Cross-platform operating system.
5.Site optimization across specialized servers
6.Support for front-end tools like Ajax, jQuery, Pyjamas, etc.
7.Supports multi-Language and multi-characters.


Django	                                                                    Flask

Django could be a Python-based free, open source
system which takes after the MVT(model view Template)
approach of structural design	                         Flask could be a Python-based smaller scale
                                                         system without any set of specific instruments
                                                         or outside libraries. It too doesn’t have a
                                                         database layer or arrangements for shape approval
                                                         and makes utilize of expansions.


Urls.py is utilized to set the association properties
and demands are handled by the primary coordinating
see of regex list	                                    URI is most regularly than not set by the see
                                                        decorator and centralized setup is additionally
                                                        conceivable. Some time recently the designs are
                                                        coordinated with the URIs, the last mentioned is
                                                        sorted in a default arrange.


Doesn’t exclude setting flexibility	                    It is accepted that all the conceivable stages to
                                                        organize a Flask code rises to the applications
                                                        number show in flask as of now


Extend Layout is Conventional extend structure	        Extend Layout is Arbitrary structure

Django gives an all-inclusive encounter: you get an
admin board, database interfacing, an ORM, and registry
structure for your apps and ventures out of the box.	   Flask gives straightforwardness, adaptability
                                                           and fine-grained control. It is unopinionated
