13.why django is a full stack Web framework:

There were no dedicated JavaScript front-end frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, Ember, and the rest.
As a result Django comes with an intentionally basic Templating Language that can perform basic logic
such as loops and filters. ... Most Django developers therefore fall into the back-end camp of the
full-stack spectrum.

Python is a powerful high-level programming language that can be possibly used in a lot of fields.
These fields can range from data science to automation and web development. It also has amazing
libraries and frameworks that include pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, selenium, OpenCV, bottle, pyramid,
flask, etc. One such framework in Python that is used for web development majorly is Django.

Django is a full-stack web framework that is open-sourced and follows an MVT (Model View Template)
type of architecture. It is comprised of a set of components and modules that aids in faster
development and is used by a few of the worldâ€™s top companies like Instagram, Mozilla, Spotify,
Quora, YouTube, Reddit, Pinterest, Dropbox, bitly, Google, Disqus, etc
