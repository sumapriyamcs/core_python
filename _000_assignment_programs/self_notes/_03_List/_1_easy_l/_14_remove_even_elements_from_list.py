# P14. REQ : Remove even elements and print list
"""
1. CRUD       -->  delete
2. STATE      -->  list
3. BEHAVIOR   -->  list  |   %  !=  ==  | for if
"""

# 0. Mathematics
"""
1.Traverse each number in the list by using for...in loop.
2.Check the condition i.e. checks number is divisible by 2 or not â€“ to check EVEN,
number must be divisible by 2.
3.If number is divisible by 2 i.e. EVEN number, remove the number from the list.
4.To remove the number from the list, use list. remove() method.
