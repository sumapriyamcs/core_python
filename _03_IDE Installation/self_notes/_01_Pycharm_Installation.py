INSTALLATION OF PYCHARM:?

Step 1.

Download PyCharm from the JetBrains website. You will have the option of using the Professional version or the Community version. This guide installs the Community edition.
 Note: It is also a good idea to confirm that Python is installed.

Step 2.

After running the installer, select the installation location.
The most common location is in our Program Files directory, but this can be changed to an alternative location if needed, but this is usually unnecessary

Step 3.

Next, we will be prompted to select our installation options.
These include the option to add a desktop shortcut, updating your path to include PyCharm launcher along with any associating file types, and a context menu. You can see below the choices I have selected for my installation.
Feel free to choose what is best for your development style.


Step 4.

The next step is to choose your start menu folder location, for a quick reference from your desktop start page.

Step 5.

Now, we wait for PyCharm to install.
If you wish to see additional details of the installation, you can select show details.

Step 6.

Finally, reboot the computer at the end of the PyCharm installation process.

**How Do I Configure PyCharm?

Step 1.

When we open PyCharm the first time, we will initially be prompted with featured plugins we can download to emulate a Vim editor, R language support, or an AWS Toolkit. A more detailed plugin list is available in settings.
Feel free to install and enable the ones that best suit your needs.

Step 2.

From the main screen, we can create a new project, open an existing one
or select one from our versioning control system of choice, like GIT.
We can also see the configuration options in the bottom right corner
and ask for help which can be useful in moving forward.

Step 3.

When creating a new project, we will be asked a few questions like where would we like to place our project folder and any related files which need to be saved.
Or, whether we would like a main.py created by default
and other Python interpreter options unique to our environment.

If you did not install Python before installing PyCharm, you will get a warning
