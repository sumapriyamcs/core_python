#ARRAY:

1.An array is defined as a collection of items that are stored at contiguous memory locations.

2.It is a container which can hold a fixed number of items, and these items should be of the same type.

3.An array is popular in most programming languages like C/C++, JavaScript, etc.

4.Array is an idea of storing multiple items of the same type together
and it makes easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to the base value.

5.A combination of the arrays could save a lot of time by reducing the overall size of the code.

6. It is used to store multiple values in single variable.

If you have a list of items that are stored in their corresponding variables like this:

car1 = "Lamborghini"

car2 = "Bugatti"

car3 = "Koenigsegg"

If you want to loop through cars and find a specific one, you can use the array.

7.The array can be handled in Python by a module named array.
8.It is useful when we have to manipulate only specific data values.
Following are the terms to understand the concept of an array:

==>>Element - Each item stored in an array is called an element.

==>>Index - The location of an element in an array has a numerical index,
which is used to identify the position of the element.

#Array Representation:

1.An array can be declared in various ways and different languages.
The important points that should be considered are as follows:

1.1 Index starts with 0.
1.2 We can access each element via its index.
1.3 The length of the array defines the capacity to store the elements.

#Array operations:

Some of the basic operations supported by an array are as follows:

1.Traverse - It prints all the elements one by one.
2.Insertion - It adds an element at the given index.
3.Deletion - It deletes an element at the given index.
4.Search - It searches an element using the given index or by the value.
5.Update - It updates an element at the given index.

The Array can be created in Python by importing the array module to the python program.

#Accessing array elements:

    We can access the array elements using the respective indices of those elements.

#How to change or add elements:

    Arrays are mutable, and their elements can be changed

#Why to use arrays in Python?
    A combination of arrays saves a lot of time. The array can reduce the overall size of the code.

#How to delete elements from an array?

1.The elements can be deleted from an array using Python's del statement.
2.If we want to delete any value from the array,
3.we can do that by using the indices of a particular element.

#Finding the length of an array

1.The length of an array is defined as the number of elements present in an array.
2.It returns an integer value that is equal to the total number of the elements present in that array.

#Array Concatenation

1.We can easily concatenate any two arrays using the + symbol.

#Removing Array Elements

1.You can use the pop() method to remove an element from the array.

#Insertion Operation

1.Insert operation is to insert one or more data elements into an array.
2.Based on the requirement, a new element can be added at the beginning, end, or any given index of array.

#Search Operation

1.You can perform a search for an array element based on its value or its index.

2.we search a data element using the python in-built index() method.

#Update Operation

1.Update operation refers to updating an existing element from the array at a given index.

2. we simply reassign a new value to the desired index we want to update.
