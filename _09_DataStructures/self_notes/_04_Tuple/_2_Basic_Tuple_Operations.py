##Basic Tuple operations:

  The operators like concatenation (+), repetition (*), Membership (in) works
  in the same way as they work with the list.

1.Repetition
    The repetition operator enables the tuple elements to be repeated multiple times.

ex:T1*2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

2.Concatenation
    It concatenates the tuple mentioned on either side of the operator.

ex:T1+T2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

3.Membership
    It returns true if a particular item exists in the tuple otherwise false

ex:print (2 in T1) prints True.

4.Iteration:
	The for loop is used to iterate over the tuple elements.

ex:for i in T1:
    print(i)

5.Length:
	It is used to get the length of the tuple.

ex:len(T1) = 5
