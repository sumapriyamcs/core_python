#programs:

1. write a program to access the values in the tuple?

tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000);
tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 );
print ("tup1[0]:", tup1[0]);
print ("tup2[1:5]: ", tup2[1:5]);


2.write a program to update a two tuples?

tup1 = (12, 34.56);
tup2 = ('abc', 'xyz');
tup3 = tup1 + tup2;
print (tup3);

3. write a program to delete a tuple?
tup = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000);
print (tup);
del tup;
print ("After deleting tup:");
print (tup);

4.write a program to create a tuple?
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple)
my_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.4)
print(my_tuple)
my_tuple = ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))
print(my_tuple)
my_tuple = 3, 4.6, "dog"
print(my_tuple)

5. write a program to access a tuple  elements  using index function?

my_tuple = ('p','e','r','m','i','t')
print(my_tuple[0])   # 'p'
print(my_tuple[5])   # 't'
n_tuple = ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))
# nested index
print(n_tuple[0][3])       # 's'
print(n_tuple[1][1])       # 4

6. write a program to count  how many words are present in the tuple?
flowers=("rose","jasmine","rose","lavender")
print(flowers.count("rose")


7. write a python program to get the index of the particular word present in the tuple?

world= ("animals","humans","trees","oceans")
print(world.index("animals"))

8.write a program by using unpacking?

a,b=(10,20)
print(a,b)#10 20
