#Numeric:

"""In Python, numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric
value can be integer, floating number or even complex numbers. These values are
defined as int, float and complex class in Python.

Integers – This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative
whole numbers (without fraction or decimal). In Python there is no limit to how
long an integer value can be.

Float – This value is represented by float class. It is a real number with floating
point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, the character e or
E followed by a positive or negative integer may be appended to specify scientific
notation.

Complex Numbers – Complex number is represented by complex class. It is
specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. For example – 2+3j"""

#Example problems:
'''a = 5
print("Type of a: ", type(a))
b = 5.0
print("Type of b: ", type(b))
c = 5+3j
print("Type of c: ", type(c))'''
