#BOOLEAN_DATATYPE:

"""Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False. Boolean objects that are
equal to True are truthy (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false).
But nonBoolean objects can be evaluated in Boolean context as well and determined to be true
or false. It is denoted by the class bool.

###--– True and False with capital ‘T’ and ‘F’ are valid booleans otherwise python will
throw an error.
