#inheritence:

"""Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.

The benefits of inheritance are
1.It represents real-world relationships well.

2.It provides reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again.
Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.

3.It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A,
then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.


# forms of Inheritance:

1. Single inheritance: When a child class inherits from only one parent class,
it is called single inheritance.


2. Multiple inheritance: When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes,
it is called multiple inheritance.

3. Multilevel inheritance: When we have a child and grandchild relationship.

4. Hierarchical inheritance: More than one derived classes are created from a single base.

5. Hybrid inheritance: This form combines more than one form of inheritance.
Basically, it is a blend of more than one type of inheritance.

Using members of one class inside another class:
We can use members of one class inside another class by using the following ways
1. By Composition (Has-A Relationship)
2. By Inheritance (IS-A Relationship)
1. By Composition (Has-A Relationship):
By using Class Name or by creating object we can access members of one class inside another class
is nothing but composition (Has-A Relationship).
The main advantage of Has-A Relationship is Code Reusability.

example:
class Engine:
    a=10
    def __init__(self):
       self.b=20
    def m1(self):
       print('Engine Specific Functionality')
class Car:
   def __init__(self):
       self.engine=Engine()
   def m2(self):
      print('Car using Engine Class Functionality')
      print(self.engine.a)
      print(self.engine.b)
      self.engine.m1()
c=Car()
c.m2()

example2:


class Car:
   def __init__(self,name,model,color):
       self.name=name
       self.model=model
       self.color=color
   def getinfo(self):
       print("Car Name:{} , Model:{} and Color:{}".format(self.name, self.model,self.color))
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, ename, eno, car):
        self.ename = ename
        self.eno = eno
        self.car = car
    def empinfo(self):
        print("Employee Name:", self.ename)
        print("Employee Number:", self.eno)
        print("Employee Car Info:")
        self.car.getinfo()
c = Car("Innova", "2.5V", "Grey")
e = Employee('Durga', 10000, c)
e.empinfo()


example3:

class X:
  a=10
  def __init__(self):
     self.b=20
  def m1(self):
     print("m1 method of X class")
class Y:
   c=30
  def __init__(self):
     self.d=40
  def m2(self):
     print("m2 method of Y class")
  def m3(self):
     x1=X()
     print(x1.a)
     print(x1.b)
     x1.m1()
     print(Y.c)
     print(self.d)
     self.m2()
     print("m3 method of Y class")
y1=Y()
y1.m3()

2.By Inheritance(IS-A Relationship):


What ever variables, methods and constructors available in the parent class by
default available to the child classes and we are not required to rewrite.
Hence the main advantage of inheritance is Code Reusability and we can extend existing
functionality with some more extra functionality.

#Syntax :
class childclass(parentclass):

example:

class P:
    a = 10
    def __init__(self):
        self.b = 10
    def m1(self):
        print('Parent instance method')
    @classmethod

     def m2(cls):
        print('Parent class method')
    @staticmethod

    def m3():
        print('Parent static method')
class C(P):
    pass
c = C()
print(c.a)
print(c.b)
c.m1()
c.m2()
c.m3()


#IS-A vs HAS-A Relationship::


If we want to extend existing functionality with some more extra functionality then we should go
for IS-A Relationship

If we dont want to extend and just we have to use existing functionality then we should go for
HAS-A Relationship
