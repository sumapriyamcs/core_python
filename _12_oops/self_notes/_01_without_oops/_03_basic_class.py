#class

A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.
Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances
of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it
for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods
(defined by their class) for modifying their state.

#object:
An Object is an instance of a Class.
A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.

An object consists of :

State: It is represented by the attributes of an object.
It also reflects the properties of an object.

Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object.
It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.

Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one
object to interact with other objects.

#encapsulation:

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP).
It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit.
This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent
the accidental modification of data.

#Access Modifiers in Python:

Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring the data members and methods of a class
either as private or protected. But In Python, we donâ€™t have direct access modifiers
like public, private, and protected. We can achieve this by using single underscore
and double underscores.

Access modifiers limit access to the variables and methods of a class.
Python provides three types of access modifiers private, public, and protected.

Public Member: Accessible anywhere from otside oclass.
Private Member: Accessible within the class
Protected Member: Accessible within the class and its sub-classes

#Abstraction in Python:

Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users.
The users only interact with the basic implementation of the function, but inner working is hidden.
User is familiar with that "what function does" but they don't know "how it does."

#Python Inheritance:

Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all
the methods and properties from another class.
Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

1.Single inheritance

2.Multi-level inheritance

3.Multiple inheritance

4.Multipath inheritance

5.Hierarchical Inheritance

6.Hybrid Inheritance

#polymorphism:

The word polymorphism means having many forms. ... Real life example of polymorphism:
A person at the same time can have different characteristic.
Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee.
So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.
