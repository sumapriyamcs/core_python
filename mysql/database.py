"""
Database:
A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, stored
in our local system.Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications
that are associated with them,
are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

DBMS:

Database Management Systems (DBMS) are used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data.
A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users
to create, read, update,
and delete data in the database.

DBMS manage the data, the database engine, and the database schema, allowing
for data to be manipulated
or extracted by users and other programs. This helps provide data security,
data integrity, concurrency,and uniform data administration procedures.


what is progresSQL ?

It is a highly stable database management system, backed by more than 20 years
of community development
which has contributed to its high levels of resilience, integrity, and correctness.
PostgreSQL is used as
the primary data store or data warehouse for many web, mobile, geospatial,
and analytics applications.

What is difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?

SQL server is a database management system which is mainly used for e-commerce
and providing different data warehousing solutions.
PostgreSQL is an advanced version of SQL which provides support to different functions of SQL like
foreign keys, sub queries, triggers, and different user-defined types and functions.

What is OLAP?

Online Analytical Processing, a category of software tools which provide analysis
of data for business decisions.
OLAP systems allow users to analyze database information from multiple database systems at one time.
The primary objective is data analysis and not data processing.

What is OLTP?

Online transaction processing shortly known as OLTP supports transaction-oriented
applications in a 3-tier
architecture. OLTP administers day to day transaction of an organization.

Application developer tools: sql-dev, oracle designer, oracle developer, sqlplus, pl/sql. postgresql

Data types:

1.Numeric: int, float, decimal, number
2.cheracter/string: char, varchar, varchar(2),
  char - predefined length upto 2000 bytes
  varchar-

2.DML - Data manupulation Language
  insert: to insert data into row wise row wise
  update: to update the data in table of specific item
